\section*{Abstract}
The examination of the design and implementation of various image filters is the focus of 
this assignment. Three primary filters are employed for this purpose: median, 
low-pass Gaussian, and moving average. Images with various forms of noise are subjected 
to the filters. The performance efficacy of each image filter in reducing the noise of 
each image is evaluated by introducing Gaussian and Salt \& Pepper noises to the images. 
Diverse filter diameters are developed to identify the most effective filter. 
Following this, a variety of linear filters are generated and applied to each image to observe 
their impact on the image. Lastly, the Fourier transform of the images is computed, 
and the log magnitude graphs of the image and filters are displayed to determine 
the information that the Fourier transform of an image or filter provides.
