\section{Conclusion }\label{P5}

For the purpose of this project, a number of distinct kinds of noises were applied to an image.
After that, various kinds of filters were applied to each noisy image in order to evaluate 
how well the filter handled the process of removing the noise. In a nutshell, 
the specifications of the image processing task should be taken into consideration 
when selecting the appropriate filter. It is possible for moving averages to blur details 
and edges, despite their simplicity and efficiency. The use of Gaussian filters provides 
an excellent compromise between the reduction of noise and the preservation of detail. 
When it comes to reducing impulse noise, median filters are fantastic; however, 
they might not be as effective when dealing with Gaussian noise. 
When it comes to image processing, it is usual practice to employ a variety of filters 
in order to produce the desired results.
